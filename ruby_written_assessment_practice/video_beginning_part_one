###Ruby syntatical Sugar
  makes the code easier to read but often hides what the code is doing

ex: Describe the following code
'puts "hello"'

'puts' is a method invocation and the string '"Hello"' is passed to the method.

  could pass a local variable or a method
  ruby defaults to the local variable unless parenthesis are used after the method
  parenthesis are optional  <= syntatical sugar
Co  
Global variables start with a dollar sign

Object oriented programming
'name=' is a method invocation

  this is another case where we don't use parenthesis

### Where does code come from?
Core API
  loaded into the Ruby runtime that allows you to invoke methods
  organized into classes and modules  == ways to organize methods
  kernel: core, important module
    puts
  hashes, arrays, strings... are methods are availble to us

Standard API
  not automatically loaded
  access by requiring it
  
Gems
  augment, replace, or new info
  external libraries
  ex 'require "pry"'
  
Adding codes from other programs
  ruby on rails

Metaprogramming
  creating methods on the fly that you can't access

###local variable scope
Local variables initialized outside the block are accessible inside the block
if it is initialized inside the block then it is not accessible outside the block
accessing the variable inside the block can allow us to mutate the variable

initialition and reassignment has the same syntax
