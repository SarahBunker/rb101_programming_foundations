Formal Pseudo-Code

keyword	    meaning
----------------
START	      start of the program
SET	        sets a variable we can use for later
GET	        retrieve input from user
PRINT     	displays output to user
READ	      retrieve value from variable
IF/ELSE IF  show conditional branches in logic
/ELSE	
WHILE	      show looping logic
END	        end of the program

For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

a method that returns the sum of two integers
a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

------------------------------------------
a method that returns the sum of two integers
welcome user
Get the input from the user for first num
get second input
calculate result
print result

START
PRINT welcome
GET   num1
GET   num2
calculate result
PRINT result
END

------------------------------------
a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
initialize empty string
input array of strings
iterate
add element to string by removing from array
return array

START
PRINT welcome
SET  string to empty
GET  array
WHILE there are still elements in array
    take of element and add to string
PRINT result
END

-----------------------------------------
a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

input is an array
output is a new array with every other element (array is half as big as first one)
start with an empty new array
iterate through old array by storing every other value
return new array

START
SET iterator (using .each with index you could use the index as the iterator)
WHILE less then length of array
  loop through the values and take only the ones where the iterator is odd
  store those values in array
return array
PRINT return
END
