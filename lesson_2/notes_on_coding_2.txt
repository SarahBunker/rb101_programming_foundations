use new lines to separate code

don't write codes that have side effects (mutates or prints something) and has a meaningful return

Naming methods
  if method prints values use display_ or print_ in the name
  design methods so they are black box, the name tells you what they do, not how they do it
  
Don't mutate caller during iteration
  typical to mutate the elements of caller, but not the caller itself
  don't mutate the collection you are iterating over or you will get unexpected results
  
Choose appropriate block name variables to avoid variable shadowing

Don't use assignment in a conditional even if it is on purpose, because it is unclear if it is a bug or on purpose
  if you need to get the conditional value from somewhere else do it the line before the conditional, and then use it in the code

Use an _ for unused block parameters
  printing the same string for each element in the array, but the element doesn't matter
