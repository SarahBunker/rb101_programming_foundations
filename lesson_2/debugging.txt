Steps to debug (some until you hone your own)
  reproduce the error
  determine boundaries of the error
  trace code backwards to find out where error starts
  understand problem well
  implement fix (one problem at a time)
  test fix

other debugging techniques
  line by line > usually the error is in the details not in misunderstanding something
  rubber duck > explain what code is supposed to do
  walk away > leave the problem after you understand it and let back of brain work on it
  pry
  
PRY
require "pry" (at top of doc)

binding.pry (insert anywhere in code)

Ctrl + D (to continue after stopping to examine code)

exit-program (exits the program, useful when binding was used in a loop)


>> use pry to avoid spraying code with puts statments
