require 'date'

puts Date.civil
puts Date.civil(2016)
puts Date.civil(2016, 5)
puts Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)

What will each of the 4 puts statements print?
The first one goes back crazy far
the next three start out
1/1/2016 but puts it in the order year-month-day
next adds the month 2016-5-1
finally adds a day 2016-5-13

###################
the [] show that the arguements are optional

In the following code which arguements are optional?
civil([year=-4712[, month=1[, mday=1[, start=Date::ITALY]]]]) â†’ date

all of them, but because they are nested if you omit one then you have to omit all of the inner ones below it
for example omitting month means omitting the start and day as well.
