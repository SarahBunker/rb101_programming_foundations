first, last = [last, first + last] ~ assigning two variables at the same time without intermediary

#their solution used
#all_digits[-n..-1] = rotate_array(all_digits[-n..-1])
#they assigned the last digits with the rotated digits.
>> you can assign digits while accessing them, don't need intermediary

You don't have to remove items from array to itterate through them
