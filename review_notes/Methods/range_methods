range: seems like I have to write it from biggest to smallest and then reverse the values if
I want it in the opposite order.

(-10..1).to_a.reverse
(1..-10) << doesn't work

using range with case statements to create intervals while doing a case statement
  when 90..100 then "A"
  when 80..89 then "B"
  when 70..79 then "C"
  when 60..69 then "D"
  when 0 ..59 then "F"
  end
