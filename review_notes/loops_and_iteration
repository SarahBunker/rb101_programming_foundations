loop do... end            #must include a break statement
while Boolean ... end     #evaluate until condition is false
until Boolean ... end     #evaluate until condition is true
for i in range ... end    #typically used to iterate over a collection (for example a range, or aray)
Num.times                 #counts from 0 to 0ne less then the specified number

break     #exits current loop
next      #goes to next iteration imediately, skipping the rest of the current iteration 

loop basics
basics of looping: a loop, a counter, a way to retrieve the current value, and a way to exit the loop

counter = 0
loop do
  break if counter == numbers.size
  puts numbers[counter]
  counter += 1
end

## Basic format to get user input
loop do
  puts "Enter input"
  answer = gets.chomp
  break if answer == "yes"
  puts "incorrect answer. please enter yes"
end

  - the error message is after the break statement

name convention in for loops
for friend in friends
for cat in cats
etc

Iteration Methods

use a range to easily get an index without initializing it
example

(1..row_num).each do |current_row_number|
  rows << create_row(current_row_number)
end

.each takes the place of the basic loop returns original array or hash
  # Iteration
  * doesn't consider return value of block
  * returns original array
  * array has same length of original
.select ~ selects the truthy values
  # Selection
  * considers the truthiness of the return value of the block
  * returns a new collection
  * new collection has same or less length
  takes the place of loop for selection returns truthy values of the block
    "puts num" inside block will return an empty array because the block will never be truthy
  num +2 would return a new array, that is a copy of the original array
    num + 2 is truthy so all iterations are truthy and the full array is returned
.map used for transformations
  # Transformations
  * uses return value of block for new array
  * returns a new collection
  * new collecion has same length as original
  takes value from block and places it in a new array
  
  when used on a hash returns an array
  
.each
  > defined in array or method class
.map and .select
  > this method comes from enumerable class which is made avalible to the array and hash class
